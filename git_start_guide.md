# Getting Started with Git
## What is Git?
  Git is a version control system created by Linus Torvalds (the same guy behind Linux). Git provides programmers with a way to save code and look back on previous versions.
## Installing Git
  For the purposes of this guide, I'll limit the instructions for setting up Git to MacOS, but it can be installed on any system.
  Ensure that Homebrew is installed and use the command below to install Git.
  ```
  brew install git
  ```
