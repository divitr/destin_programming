# Learning Goals
## This project achieves two goals:
 - A gentle introduction to supervised learning techniques
 - An excercise in basic python
    - Abstraction
    - Functions
    - Data representation
    - Mathematical operations
 ## By the end of this project, you should have a robust understanding of:
   - Supervised learning
   - K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) algorithm
   - The implementation of the KNN algorithm
      - The intuition motivating supervised learning techniques, specifically KNN
      - Choosing an appropriate value for K
      - Evaluating performance of a machine learning model
      - Handling categorical data using one-hot encoding
# Project Overview
## Supervised Learning
 Before understanding what the KNN algorithm is or does, we should first learn about supervised learning. Supervised learning is a subset of machine learning in which the model is provided with features[^1] and a label[^2] for each data point.
 label
 : what we are asking the model to predict; the output of the model
## Your 

[^1]: features are the information that the model is given; the inputs to the model
[^2]: labels are twhat we are asking the model to predict; the output of the model
