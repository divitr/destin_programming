# Learning Goals
This project achieves two goals:
 - A gentle introduction to supervised learning techniques
 - An excercise in basic python
    - Abstraction
    - Functions
    - Data representation
    - Mathematical operations
      
 By the end of this project, you should have a robust understanding of:
   - Supervised learning
   - K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) algorithm
   - The implementation of the KNN algorithm
      - The intuition motivating supervised learning techniques, specifically KNN
      - Choosing an appropriate value for K
      - Evaluating performance of a machine learning model
      - Handling categorical data using one-hot encoding
